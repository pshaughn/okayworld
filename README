Deployment is currently a manual process.

1
copy cert.js.initial to cert.js
copy servertstate.json.initial to serverstate.json

2
point your webserver (https or not) at the /web subdirectory

3
if you are using https:
edit cert.js to point to your cert.pem and key.pem, and make sure the user you'll run as can read those files (chgrp is a much better idea than running as root)
OR
if you are not using https:
edit cert.js to set module.exports.secure=false
edit web/client.html to use ws:// instead of wss://

4
if the webserver is not the same host as the game server:
(TODO origin header check stuff, once that check is being made)
modify findserver.js so OKAY_SOCKET_SERVER_URL points at the game server

5
edit admin1 and changeme in serverstate.json to your desired admin username and password (the password will be hashed once the server starts)

6
run server.js somehow (TODO: daemonization instructions; you can just run it manually for quick tests)

If the process dies, everything that happened since it started will be forgotten. To retain user accounts and game state, stop it via the web interface's "clean shutdown" button.
